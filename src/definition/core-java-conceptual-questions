A.The main method is the entry point of a Java application. Specifically„ÄÅwhen the Java Virtual Machine is told to run an application by specifying its class (by using the java application launcher), it will look for the main method with the signature of public static void main(String[])

Why main is static?
A. This is necessary because main() is called by the JVM before any objects are made.
 Since it is static it can be directly invoked via the class. Similarly, we use static sometime for user defined methods so that we need not to make objects. void indicates that the main() method being declared does not return a value.

Explain Java Heap space and Garbage collection?

A. When the heap becomes full, garbage is collected.

stacks and native handles are allocated in memory separate from the heap, as well as JVM internal data structures.
Can you guarantee the garbage collection process?
A. no
What is the difference between stack and heap in Java?

Whenever an object is created, it's always stored in the Heap space and stack memory contains the reference to it.
